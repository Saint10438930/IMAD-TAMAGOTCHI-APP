# MY TAMAGOTCHI APP

The purpose of this app is to serve as a simulation for a virtual pet, allowing its users to take care of it, play with it, and also feed the pet. Mostly for entertainment purposes.


## Documentation

The First thing you see when you run the app is "Saint" my virtual pet.
I used an image downloaded from google. Then i added a button("Woof") which has the function to take you to the next page, where all the activities happen.

On The second page (which is where all the activities happen), you will find Saint the virtual pet standing. Then you will notice three buttons(Eat,Wash, and Play). When you press the button "Eat" an image of a dog ("Saint") will pop up showing that ou are feeding him ("Saint"). Then you will notice that the hunger text view will increase showing his hunger levels.When you press the button "Wash" an image of a dog ("Saint") will pop up showing that you are taking care of the dog. Also you will notice his health levels increase.When you press the button "Play" an image of a dog ("Saint") will pop up showing that hes playing, and hes happy.

The images popping up on the second page were AI generated using Nightcafe.
